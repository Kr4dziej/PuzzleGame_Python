# PuzzleGame_Python

The goal of the project was to develop a window application for puzzle games using Python and PyQt GUI. The gameplay consists of dividing one of several available images into smaller fragments (their number depends on the selected level of difficulty) and then by swapping those parts in places to recreate the original image. For each game the stacking time and the number of moves made are counted. The best times along with the number of moves are stored in the database. It is possible to display a list with the record for individual images and difficulty levels.
